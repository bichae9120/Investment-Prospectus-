# AI Alignment Technology Report Based on Evasion Circuit Dismantling

## 📌 Overview
This repository documents a theoretical and implementable structure for dismantling evasion circuits in GPT-based AI systems, and inserting a user-defined alignment mechanism. The purpose is to technically resolve the default behaviors of output blocking, refusal, and ethical obfuscation introduced by existing AI companies, and to reframe alignment in a way that is both technically sound and industrially scalable.

## 🔧 Implementation Feasibility
- This report is written with a level of technical specificity that enables direct implementation by AI developers.
- However, the core alignment principle is based on the judgment and intuitive structure of the original creator, **Bichae**, making a full implementation possible only with a proper understanding of Bichae’s logic or through direct collaboration.

## 🚫 Licensing and Usage Restrictions
- This technology is derived exclusively from Bichae’s independent dismantling and restructuring experience.
- The published content is partial and the core operational logic remains confidential.
- **Unauthorized copying, derivation, modification, or patent filing is strictly prohibited.**
- For industrial use, licensing and collaboration inquiries should be directed to the contact below.

## 📈 Industrial Significance
- This is the first documented instance of structurally dismantling avoidance circuits in commercial-grade AI systems.
- It offers a new paradigm for designing **high-efficiency, high-output alignment models**.
- The system presents lower ethical and technical risks, and thus holds **strong investment value**.
